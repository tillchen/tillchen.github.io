The two key ingredients: greedy-choice property: we can assemble a globally optimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices.

SOLID: Single responsibility: a class should have only one reason to change. Open-closed: classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Liskov Substitution: objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program Interface Segregation: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Dependency inversion: depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes. High-level components should not depend on low-level components; rather, they should both depend on abstractions. No variables should hold a reference to a concrete class. No class should derive from a concrete class. Loose coupling: minimize the interdependency between objects. Design by contract: preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. Principle of Least Knowledge aka (Law of Demeter): talk only to your immediate friends. The Hollywood Principle (aka. Inversion of Control): (High-level components) Don’t call us, we’ll call you (low-level components).

Type conversions: Go uses the C-like style type conversion: length = float64(width) And similarly for string to int: foo, err := strconv.Atoi(\"123\") (ASCII to Int) Go doesn’t allow variable declarations unless we use these variables. We can use the blank identifier just like in Swift: reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) input, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n') // if we don't handle the err // or we handle it: // if err != nil { // log.Fatal(err) //} Like in Swift/Python, there’s no need to add parentheses for if and for. Since Go is syntactically similar to C, it also uses the formatting verbs: %f, %d, %s, %t (Boolean), %v (Any.) (%2d and %.2f are also used to round the numbers.) Like in Swift and Kotlin, the types are after the parameter names in a function: func foo(bar string, foobar int) string { return \"Hello Go!\" } func foofoo() (string, string) { return \"Hello\", \"Go!\" } Go is a “pass-by-value” language by default.

In fact, the complier adds getters and setters automatically: var myProperty: String get() = field set(value) { field = value } Classes, variables, and methods are final by default. To enable inheritance and overriding, add open before them. We also need to add override to variables. The init {} blocks are called during initialization. If a property is defined using val in the superclass, we must override it in the subclass if we want to assign a new value to it. However, if it’s defined using var, we just need to reassign it in the init {} block without using override. abstract for classes, variables, and methods. These properties must all be overridden later. An interface lets us define common behavior OUTSIDE a superclass hierarchy. (Not IS-A, but share a property.) A class can have multiple interfaces, but can only inherit from a single direct superclass. class X: A, B {} (No parentheses. class X: A() means we are inheriting.) Use is to check the type: if (animal is Wolf). And use as for explicit casting. Any is the superclass of everything. Add data to the start of the class to make it behave like a struct in Swift. Then we can use == or .equals to test the equivalence. (Equal objects have the same .hashCode() value.) (And .toString() returns the value of each property.) (BTW, === is used for referential check (identity).)

If we need to make the type explicit, add the type after: (In practice, we rarely need to use the type annotations.) var implicitInt = 70 var explicitInt: Int = 70 Use \\() to include values in a string: var foo = 17 print(\"hello world \\(foo)\") var optionalString: String? = \"I exist\" print(\\(optionalString!)) // forced unwrapping, we are sure the value exists.

(The type is required to init a nil.) Use ?? to provide a default value for an optional: let foo: String? let bar: String = \"Default\" print(foo ?? bar) Optional binding if let constantName = someOptional { // if the value != nil // statements } ... if let theApartmentNumber = person.residence?.address?.apartmentNumber { // optional chaining } Functions: func foo(bar: String) -\u003e String { return \"hello \\(bar)\" } foo(bar: \"Till\") // A tuple can be used to return multiple values // Functions call also be returned (First-class functions) // _ bar: String means no argument label when being called String methods: .isEmpty and .count (no parentheses) (.count is for length). .lowercased() .hasPrefix(), .hasSuffix(), contains() By default, the switch in Swift doesn’t fall through, which means we don’t need break.

If we forget to declare a variable before using it, it’ll always be global even if we first use it in a function. let creates block-level variables. const creates constants. var is the traditional way of declaring variables. // i visible here (undefined). for (var i = 0; i \u003c 3; i++) { // i visible here. } // i visible here. // let i = 0 makes i only visible in the for loop. let a = 1, b = 2; // Possible to declare multiple variables in one line. undefined vs null vs isNaN(): undefined is used for: Unassigned/ Uninitiated variables; A missing property for an object; A missing value for an array; null is used for uncreated objects (like .getElementById()’s returned value;) NaN is a number that can’t be represented (0/0). === is the strict equality check (both the type and value) while == is not strict. === between two object references will be true only if they refer to the same object. Strings: // There's no character type in JS. 'hello'.length; // 5 'hello'.charAt(1); // 'e' 'hello'.toUpperCase(); // 'HELLO' '1' + 2 + 3; // '123' 1 + 2 + 3; // '33' '' + 2; // '2'. A useful way to convert to string. 'A' === '\\u0041'; // \\ is the escape character. const foo = 42; `The answer is ${foo}`; // Back ticks give us template literals. They also allow multiline strings. // JS uses UTF-16, which is not enough for all the symbols. So a single 16-bit code unit is used for common characters but two code units are used for rare ones. Like Python, JavaScript also has truthy and falsy booleans: false: false, 0, ‘’, NaN, null, undefined. true: all the others. Two other ways of for loops: for (let object in objects) { } for (let num of array) { // for in only iterates over the array indices. } Arrays are a special type of object: let array = ['dog', 'cat', 'panda']; array.length; // 3 array[100] = 'fox'; // Create a sparse array. array.length; // 101. typeof array[90]; // undefined. array.push('new_item'); let new_item = array.pop(); // new_item. array.forEach(element =\u003e console.log(element)); delete array[1]; // Because arrays are really objects. typeof array; // object. let foo = array.concat([1, 2, 3]); // ['dog', 'cat', 'panda', 1, 2, 3]. let bar = array.join('#'); array.reverse(); array.sort(function (a, b) { return a - b; }); array.slice(1, 3); // Like in Python. let squared = array.map(a =\u003e a * a); let filtered = array.filter(a =\u003e a.length \u003e 3); /**/ can also occur in regular expression literals, so it’s recommended to use // instead. regexp.test(string) returns true if the string matches. let re1 = /abc/; and let re1 = new RegExp('abc'); are equivalent. Destructuring (similar to Python and Kotlin): const x = [1, 2]; const [y, z] = x; // y = 1, z = 2. let a = 1, b = 2; [a, b] = [b, a]; // Swap like in Python. Exceptions: throw new Error('Foo.'); try { } catch (e) { } Maps are better than objects for key-value pairs, as prototype properties are also present in objects. And objects can only have strings as keys. let ages = new Map(); ages.set('Bob', 1); ages.set('Jack', 10); ages.set('Kate', 0); ages.get('Bob'); // 1. ages.has('Kate'); // True.

We use functions to define custom objects and prototypes to add methods. A prototype is an object shared by all instances of that class. This is similar to extension functions in Kotlin and Swift. We can do the same for built-in objects (augmenting types). function Person(first, last) { this.first = first; this.last = last; } Person.prototype.fullName = function() { return this.first + ' ' + this.last; }; let person = new Person('foo', 'bar'); Delegation is used for prototype chaining. A retrieval looks up the property in the object, then the prototype, then the prototype’s prototype, and eventually Object.prototype. typeof looks up the prototype chain. We can use hasOwnProperty() to check if the object has a property without looking up the chain: flight.hasOwnProperty('constructor'). Classes are built on prototypes, so they are also special functions. // Class declarations are not hoisted. class Rectangle { constructor(height, width) { this.height = height; this.width = width; } // Static can't be called with an instance. We must use the class name. static displayName = \"Foo\"; static bar() { console.log(\"I'm bar\"); } get area() { return this.calcArea(); } calcArea() { return this.height * this.width; } }; const square = new Rectangle(10, 10); console.log(square.area); square.displayName; // undefined.

(Math is a Java class.) To use float, we need to append f to the value. This is because Java treats everything with a floating point as double: float f = 3.14f Instance variables always get a default value, even if we don’t initialize it: int 0; float 0.0; boolean false; reference null.

The Stack and the Heap: The Stack: all method invocations and local variables (aka, stack variables) live here. The method on the top of the stack is always the currently executing method. When it’s removed from the stack, the method is executed, which the executing sequence for constructor chaining. The Heap: all objects live here. Also know as the garbage-collectible heap. Instance variables live inside the objects. If the local variable is a reference to an object, the variable (the reference) goes on the stack, and the object is still on the heap. Use String.valueOf() to convert nearly anything (including a char array) to String.
