## About Me

Hi there! You may call me Till, which is my nickname:D!

In my high school, I was eager to become a theoretical physicist (or more precisely, astrophysicist) because of my fascination with the beauty and the grandeur of Mother Nature. I relished in the mathematical, philosophical, and logical thinking while doing physics.

However, thanks to these three mind-blowing books:

* [The Sentient Machine: The Coming Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466959-the-sentient-machine?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=k0Ey92dgkk&rank=1)
* [Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34272565-life-3-0?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ElsA2TwiLK&rank=1)
* [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence)

I saw the bright and limitless future of AI and was determined to enter the field of computer science.

Now as a computer science undergraduate at Jacobs University Bremen (an English-speaking university in Bremen, Germany), I'm deeply in love with not only theoretical CS, AI, and machine learning, but also practical software development. Always highly motivated and self-driven to learn new things, I'm striving to achieve both academic and technical excellence.

Plus, as an avid book-learner, I've been enjoying many fascinating tech books during my self-study and self-improvement. You can find the list of the books [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/70012245-tianyao-chen?shelf=tech-books).

* Favorite Area of Software Engineering: Android Development.
