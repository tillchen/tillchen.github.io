## Basics

1. `cd` alone goes to the home directory.

2. `ls -lt` gives the long format and sorted by modification time.

3. `file foo.txt` gives the file type.

4. `less foo.txt` gives the content of the file.

5. We can double click a filename to copy it.

6. `cp` copies the files.

7. `mv` moves the files or renames the files.

8. `ln` creates links.

9. Use `|` to combine commands.

10. Control A goes to the beginning.

11. Control R goes to revere searching in the history.

12. `zip -r foo.zip foo` zips the file/directory. `unzip foo.zip` unzips.

13. `grep regex foo.txt` searches in foo.txt .
    * -i for case-insensitive
    * -v for inversion 

14. `find . -name "foo*"` finds the files with the name foo* .

15. `exec zsh` and `exec bash` switch between the two shells.

16. Control N clears the current line.

## Writing Scripts

1. Put `#!/bin/bash` at the beginning of the script.

2. Use `chmod 755 foo.sh` to make the script executable for everyone. (700 for the owner only.)

## Advanced Tricks

1. `touch {a..z}{0001..0100}.txt` creates multiple files at once.

2. `grep -r "hello" .` searches for hello recursively in the current directory.

3. `wget --no-parent -r https://cnds.jacobs-university.de/courses/os-2019/src/` gets the content recursively.

4. `find . -name "*html*" -delete` removes all files containing html.

5. `command &` to run the command in the background.
