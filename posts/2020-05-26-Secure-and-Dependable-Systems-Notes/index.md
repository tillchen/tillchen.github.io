## Introduction

This is the course notes for Secure and Dependable Systems by Dr. Jürgen Schönwälder at Jacobs University Bremen.

### Recent Computing Disasters

1. Main memory and CPU memory caches: when the data need is in the main memory but not in the caches, the CPU has to wait quite a while.

2. Side channel attack: an attach where info is gained fro the physical implementation of a computer system (e.g., timing, power consumption, radiation) rather than weaknesses in an implemented algorithm itself.

3. Speculative execution: in a situation where a CPU would have to wait for slow memory, simply guess a value and continue execution speculatively.

4. Reading arbitrary memory

### Dependability Concepts and Terminology

1. System, environment and system boundary:
    * System: an entity that interacts with other entities (e.g. OS kernel)
    * Environment: the other systems. (e.g. hardware)
    * System boundary: the common frontier between the system and its environment. (e.g. the set of OS calls)
    * Systems almost never exist in isolation.

2. Components and state:
    * Components: the structure of a system is composed of a set of components, where each component is another system. The recursion stops when a component is considered atomic.
    * Total state: the set of the following states: computation, communication, stored info, interconnection, and physical condition.

3. Function and behavior:
    * Function: what the system is intended to do, which is described by the function specification.
    * Behavior: what the system does to implement its function and is described by a sequence of states.

4. Service and correct service:
    * Service: the behavior perceived by users; a user is another system that receives service from the service provider.
    * Correct service: the service that implements the system function.

5. Failure, error, and fault: (Threats)
    * Failure: service failure, when the delivered service deviates from correct service.
    * Error: the part of the total state that may lead to subsequent failure.
    * Fault: the adjudged or hypothesized cause of an error. A fault is active when it produces an error, otherwise it's dormant.
    * Fault -> Error -> Failure.

6. Dependability:
    * The ability of a system to deliver service than can justifiably be trusted.
    * The ability to avoid service failures that are more frequent and more severe than is acceptable.

7. Dependability attributes:
    * Availability: readiness to deliver
    * Reliability: continuity
    * Safety: no catastrophic consequences
    * Integrity: no improper alterations
    * Maintainability: undergo modifications
    * Confidentiality: no disclosure of info

8. Security - confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

9. Means:
    * Prevention: preventing the occurence or introduction of faults.
    * Tolerance: avoiding service failures in the presence of faults.
    * Removal: reducing the number and severity of faults.
    * Forecasting: estimating the present number, the future incidence, and the likely consequences of faults.

### Dependability Metrics

1. Reliability and MTTF/MTBF/MTTR:
    * Reliability: the probability that the system is delivering correct service in the time interval.
    * MTTF (Mean Time To Failure): non repairable.
    * MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure): repairable.
    * MTTR (Mean Time To Repair).

2. Availability: the probability that the system is delivering correct service at time t.
    * For a repairable system, A = MTBF/(MTBF + MTTR).
    * 5 nine availability means 99.999%.

3. Safety: the probability that the system is delivering correct service or has failed in the manner that does not cause harm in the interval.
    * Mean Time To Catastrophic Failure.
