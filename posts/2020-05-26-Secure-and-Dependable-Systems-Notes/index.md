## Introduction

This is the course notes for Secure and Dependable Systems by Dr. Jürgen Schönwälder at Jacobs University Bremen.

### Recent Computing Disasters

1. Main memory and CPU memory caches: when the data need is in the main memory but not in the caches, the CPU has to wait quite a while.

2. Side channel attack: an attach where info is gained fro the physical implementation of a computer system (e.g., timing, power consumption, radiation) rather than weaknesses in an implemented algorithm itself.

3. Speculative execution: in a situation where a CPU would have to wait for slow memory, simply guess a value and continue execution speculatively.

4. Reading arbitrary memory

### Dependability Concepts and Terminology

1. System, environment and system boundary:
    * System: an entity that interacts with other entities (e.g. OS kernel)
    * Environment: the other systems. (e.g. hardware)
    * System boundary: the common frontier between the system and its environment. (e.g. the set of OS calls)
    * Systems almost never exist in isolation.

2. Components and state:
    * Components: the structure of a system is composed of a set of components, where each component is another system. The recursion stops when a component is considered atomic.
    * Total state: the set of the following states: computation, communication, stored info, interconnection, and physical condition.

3. Function and behavior:
    * Function: what the system is intended to do, which is described by the function specification.
    * Behavior: what the system does to implement its function and is described by a sequence of states.

4. Service and correct service:
    * Service: the behavior perceived by users; a user is another system that receives service from the service provider.
    * Correct service: the service that implements the system function.
